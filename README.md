# frankenstein-helmet

Once upon a time there was a production of Young Frankenstein, in which there was a "brain transfer" machine.
This is the code that runs that effect.

This effect was built with an ESP8266 (Wemos D1 Mini), and two strips of WS2818B LEDs connected to `D1` and `D2`.
There is a "go" button on D5 which starts the effect. It's a royal pain to try feed 10ft of LED tape through 1/2" ID
vinyl tubing, and the LEDs are prone to breaking off. Handle with care...
